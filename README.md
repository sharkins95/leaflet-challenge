# leaflet-challenge

In this assignment, using data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), I create points on a map to indicate all the earthquakes in the last 24 hours.

My visualization is created using HTML, CSS, JS, Leaflet, and d3 to plot to earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude. From there, each of the plots is colored and sized based on the magnitude of the earthquake it represents. The map also includes pop-ups that provide more information about each of the earthquakes when a marker is clicked.
